# Elm Hangman

## What it is
The game of hangman, playable in a web browser. It was a fun way I used to help me better understand the Elm programming language.

## What it is not
Very good.
Seriously, it works and everything, it's just not the greatest thing you'll ever see. Honestly, it's hangman after all.
